# LobsterBoard Changelog

All notable changes to LobsterBoard will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Text-header widget "Show Border" checkbox now works — toggling it off removes the card background, border, and box-shadow from the `.placed-widget` container
- Fix text-header, horizontal-line, and vertical-line widgets disappearing after save/reload — unknown widget types (e.g. removed `topbar`) crashed `renderWidget`, stopping all subsequent widgets from loading
- Add guard in `renderWidget` to skip unknown widget types gracefully
- Wrap each widget render in try/catch so one bad widget can't prevent others from loading
